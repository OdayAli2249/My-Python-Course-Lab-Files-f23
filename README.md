# Python Language Course Repository

Welcome to the Python Language Course repository! This repository contains materials from a free, voluntary Python course that was organized and taught at information technology engineering, damascus university. The aim of this course was to provide a comprehensive introduction to Python programming, covering fundamental concepts and progressing to more advanced topics, including an introduction to artificial intelligence.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a resource for students and self-learners who wish to learn Python programming from scratch or enhance their existing knowledge. Each chapter in this course is designed to build on the previous ones, ensuring a smooth and logical progression through the various aspects of Python programming.
